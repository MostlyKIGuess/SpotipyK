# main ideas
- Using https://ui.shadcn.com/docs we will make a UI.
- Using Spotify API connection will be made.
- Recommendation Model will be made before all of this: https://github.com/madhavthaker/spotify-recommendation-system
- Django + react will be the main framework.


## ideas for pudding cool similar shit:

    Get the Data

    Scrape or obtain a dataset of at least 20,000-50,000 music reviews, lyrics, genre descriptions etc.
    Ensure this text data covers a wide range of music styles and opinions
    Clean and preprocess the data to remove HTML, fix encoding issues etc.

    Choose the Model

    For starting out, use the 124M parameter GPT-2 model from OpenAI
    Download from https://github.com/openai/gpt-2

    Set Up Environment

    Install Python 3.7+ and PyTorch
    Install Hugging Face Transformers library
    Set up on GPU instance if possible (Google Colab is free option)

    Fine-Tune GPT-2

    Use Hugging Face example scripts to fine-tune GPT-2 model
    Load your music text dataset
    Train on a subset first for 1-2 epochs to get a baseline

    Define Prompts

    Design prompts to provide model context on Spotify user's music data
    Example: "Based on this user's playlists of [genre] music, here is my humorous review..."

    Generate & Evaluate

    Use model to generate funny reviews conditioned on prompts
    Evaluate humor, coherence, music knowledge
    Iterate by increasing epochs, model size, prompt tweaks

    Integrate Spotify API

    Study Spotify Web API docs to authenticate user
    Fetch user's playlist/library data into your app

    Build Front-End

    Create website or app front-end where users login
    Display their music data and feed it to model
    Show generated funny review by your AI critic

    Deploy & Expand

    Deploy web app on service like Heroku
    Optionally add text-to-speech output
    Collect more data, try larger models like BLOOM

    Keep Training

    As you get more user music data, keep training the model
    Techniques like reinforcement learning can improve humor

Start small with the 124M GPT-2, get the core working, then iterate on model size and capabilities. Consistency is key - keep pushing your training data quantity and diversity.
